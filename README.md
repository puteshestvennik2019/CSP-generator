For my final project, I decided to write a remake of an old, open source game I used to play extensively: Einstein puzzle by Alexander Babichev. 
The game itself could have more fancy features, but the main goal of this project was to generate random puzzles with just enough clues to solve the game. 
I feel the algorithm could be optimized more, but I have run out of time... 
In the game, we are provided with four types of clues, as in the original puzzle attributed to Albert Einstein (also sometimes called 'Zebra' puzzle).
Hopefully, next version of the game will feature timer, high score board, etc and will be fully dynamically generated as well as responsive on various screens sizes and resolutions.
